        "annotation": "This protein is a component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes which provide the substrate for the processing events that pre-mRNAs undergo before becoming functional, translatable mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Mediates pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation. Inhibits, together with CUGBP1, insulin receptor (IR) pre-mRNA exon 11 inclusion in myoblast. Binds to the IR RNA. Binds poly(RG).", 
        "annotation": "High HNRNPH1 expression is associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer.", 
        "annotation": "HnRNP H binds to two specific G-runs in exon 5a of ACHE and activates the distal alternative 3 splice site (ss) between exons 5a and 5b. Furthermore, hnRNP H competes for binding of CstF64 to the overlapping binding sites in exon 5a, and suppresses the selection of a cryptic polyadenylation site, which additionally ensures transcription of the distal 3 ss required for the generation of AChET isoform.", 
        "annotation": "Together, these data implicate C9ORF72 GGGGCC expansion-mediated sequestration of hnRNP H as a significant contributor to neurodegeneration in C9 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Publication Status: Online-Only", 
        "annotation": "The different alternative transcript variants of HNRNPH1 exhibited different expression changes during tumorigenesis. Its mRNA and protein were overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and associated with poorer differentiation of tumor cells.", 
        "annotation": "Our findings define novel roles for hnRNPH1 as a putative oncogene, splicing factor, and an auxiliary AR coregulator.",
